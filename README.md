# DataStructures-and-Algorithms

Welcome to the **DataStructures-and-Algorithms** repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms using **C++**. It is organized into folders, each focusing on a specific category or topic.

## Folder Structure

### [1-Basic-Patterns](./1-Basic-Patterns)
This folder contains solutions and examples of fundamental coding patterns often used in problem-solving. It serves as a starting point for understanding common coding practices and building blocks for algorithms.

More folders will be added in the future as the repository grows.

## Future Additions
Here is an overview of topics that will be added to this repository in the future:

- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Implementation of classic algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.
- **Recursion and Backtracking**: Solutions to problems involving recursion and techniques like backtracking.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Popular DP problems and their optimized solutions.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms for graph traversal, shortest paths, and minimum spanning trees (e.g., BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Kruskal's).
- **Tree Data Structures**: Implementation of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Hashing**: Examples of hash maps, hash sets, and collision resolution techniques.
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Segment trees, Fenwick trees, heaps, and tries.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problems demonstrating the greedy approach.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Number theory, combinatorics, and modular arithmetic problems.
